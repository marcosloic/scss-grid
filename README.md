# scss-grid
This is my own CSS grid. I grew tired of the syntax of Boostrap. (".col-sm-6 .col-md-5 .col-md-offset-2 .col-lg-6 .col-lg-offset-0", really?)

It works on a 12-columns grid and three sizes : S, M and L. A column with "s12 m8" class will therefore occupy twelve columns on mobile and eight on larger screens.
